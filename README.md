## About the Video Course
Being a general-purpose programming language, C++ has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation. Learning the skills to be biased toward system programming and embedded programming, resource-constrained, and large systems, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use are essential building blocks of application development.

This course will introduce you to object-oriented programming (OOP). It includes an in-depth analysis of classes and the associated OOP concepts, which will empower you to implement the concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) in real life scenarios. It also provides you with the essential know-how to tackle challenges while writing your code. 

Toward the end of each section, youâ€™ll be introduced to the practical implementation of the concepts. So, get ready to get practical with advanced concepts in C++ such as Templates, Namespaces, Exception Handling, C++ Preprocessor, Pointers, and Functions. This tutorial will give you all you need to know about working with OOP in C++. All the code and supporting files for this course are available on Github at https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Building-Blocks-of-Application-Development-with-C-
